                        <p class="about-paddingB" style="color: white;">The world we live in is being rapidly automated and emerging technologies like Cloud, Internet of Things, and so forth are being continuously integrated into concepts such as Smart Cities to provide a high level of comfort to the residents with minimum human intervention [10]. A major challenge faced by corporations of developed cities is to control and regulate air quality. With the advent of modern air quality monitoring and pollution control systems, a novel prediction framework aids the process of finding effective solutions to complex problems. This project focuses on investigating the correlation between air quality and weather and building a prediction model based on the results of the exploratory analysis of historical weather and pollution data.</p>
                        <p style="color: white;">Air quality is assessed based on a banding system which measures the levels of pollutants, namely Ozone (O3), Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and Particulate matter - PM10 and PM2.5. The overall air quality index at any particular time is given as the maximum band for any pollutant.  PM2.5 is fine particulate matter of size less than 2.5 micrometres and is considered to have adverse impacts on health ranging from lung cancer to cardiovascular diseases. Although PM2.5 is a crucial factor in deciding the overall air quality index, it is currently not included as a pollutant in the UK air quality banding system issued by the Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants (COMEAP). This is because extensive monitoring of PM2.5 levels using dedicated instruments has only started since 2015 and the presently available data is insufficient for conclusive analysis. [1]</p>
                        <p style="color: white;">This project aims to predict the air quality band for PM2.5 using present and historical pollution data in combination with predicted weather data which is readily available. To solve this problem, firstly, exploratory data analysis will be conducted on available weather and pollution datasets to discover the correlation between different features. After employing suitable data cleaning and feature engineering methods based on the observations made, the feasibility of using different machine learning techniques such as classification and regression models will be analysed. </p>
